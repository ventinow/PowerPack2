this repository is to track notes, changes, ECOs and other data for the VentiNow Power Pack subsystem.  See the VentiNow documentation repository for the original documentation from Medtronic.
## History Note
The documentation references several company names.  Original work was by Newport Pacific (sp?), bought out by Covidien, work moved to france, then bought out by Medtronic.
## Function Summary
This particular PCBA (PCB Assembly) is intended to be the central controller for an external rechargeable power supply.  It is generally assumed an AC source is available for charging, and an AC-to-DC supply is incorporated as a module.  The circuit board switches between various available power sources, and controls charging of the two incorporated Li-Ion battery packs - one removeable.
